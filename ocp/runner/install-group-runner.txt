# How to create Gitlab Group Runner

    # Here's one of the youtube I did with this:
        https://youtu.be/6lfl-AGiO_k

    # create the project
    oc new-project gitlab-dev

    # add gitlab runner operator
    ***go to webui Operators/Operator Hub/
    ***search gitlab runner
    ***install the certified, use all default settinngs

    # create role/rolebinding
    ***use serviceaccount=gitlab-runner-app-sa
    ***the sa was created on installing the operator
    oc apply -f rbac.yaml

    # create the secret for the gitlab.com certificate
    ***get the certificate from the https://gitlab.com and put it in a file
    ***it's suppose to be the ca certificate but this will do as well
    ***better always get new one, gitlab from time to time update it
    oc create secret generic gitlab.com --from-file=tls.crt=gitlab.crt -n gitlab-dev

    # create the gitlab runner
    ***get the gitlab group runner token, see this https://youtu.be/D7qKoHeQL_8
    ***update the gitlab-runner.yaml with the new token
    oc apply -f gitlab-runner.yaml

    # verify
    ***go to your gitlab and check it, see above youtube how to do it
    ***also check the pod gitlab-runner from the project with status running and ready 1/1
